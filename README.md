# Viva Naturals Full Stack Demo 

To better gauge your skills as a full stack developer, we would like you to complete the following assignment. This will help our interviewers assess your strengths, and frame the conversation through the interview process. Take as much time as you need, however we ask that you not spend more than a few hours.

## Submission Instructions
1. Fork this project on GitHub. You will need to create an account if you don't already have one
2. Complete the assignment within your fork after reading below details.
3. Push all of your changes to your fork on GitHub and submit a pull request.

## Project Description
The task is to create a simple Shopping List app to manage a list of items to purchase. The app should allow you to add, edit and remove items from the list.
The project will consist of two parts:
1. A frontend created with React
	- keep the frontend simple, we are more interested in functionality and your code rather than design
2. A backend api to save the list to a db using Python/Flask
	- create REST API endpoints, you can use flask-restx or other api library to help

If you need to make any assumptions in order to complete the task, make a note of them in your comments.

Your application should be easy to set up, have a clear step by step instructions on how to run your submission and should run on Linux distros such as ubuntu, centos or debian. It should not require any non open-source software.
